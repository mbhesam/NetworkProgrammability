## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/mbhesam/NetworkProgrammability/raw/main/Lab1-2-3-Telnetlib-Lab1-2-Paramiko-Network_diagram.png)

Why do we need network automation?
Network automation allows network operations (NetOps) teams to configure, scale, protect, and integrate network infrastructure and application services more quickly than when performed manually by users

Why network automation with python:

* Python network modules
* Easy to apply changes in enterprise networks
* Increase speed of implementation and monitor networks 
* Reduce humans errors 
* Easy to code with python
* Open source code samples

Modules network automation with python in this repository:

* Telnetlib
* Paramiko
* Netmiko
* Napalm
* Ciscoconfpars



## Getting Started

This repository contains lots of code sample to automate LAN network infrastructures. to test these codes, create lab in EVE or other simulation environment and change the code upon to your network. 

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* telnetlib
* netmiko
* paramiko
* napalm
* ciscoconfpars

```sh
pip install telnetlib
pip install paramiko
pip install netmiko
pip install ciscoconfparse
pip install napalm
```
